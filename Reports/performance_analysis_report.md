# Load Testing Performance Report

**Test Period**: 30 minutes per test scenario  
**Environment**: Demo  
**Test Scenarios**: 100, 500, and 750 concurrent users  
**Date**: Generated from latest test results (04/06/2025)

## Executive Summary

Load testing was conducted across multiple API endpoints with varying user loads to assess system performance and scalability. The testing revealed both areas of robust performance and potential bottlenecks requiring attention.

## Key Findings

### System Performance Overview
- Overall success rate remains high (>99%) even under peak load
- Response times show significant variation across endpoints
- System demonstrates different scaling characteristics for different services


#### Strong Performance Areas
1. **Broadcast Authentication Service**
   - Best overall performance across all loads
   - Average response time: 316ms (100 users) → 950ms (750 users)
   - Demonstrates efficient scaling with load increase

2. **Education Content Delivery**
   - Education Playlist: Maintains stable performance
   - Average response times stay under 1.2 seconds at 750 users
   - Good scalability characteristics for content delivery

#### Areas Requiring Attention

1. **Title Creation Service**
   - Highest response times across all scenarios
   - Average response time: 1.8s (100 users) → 5.2s (750 users)
   - P95: 3.0s (100 users) → 10.3s (750 users)
   - **Recommendation**: Immediate optimization required

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - CSRF and Login services show significant degradation
   - Login P95 increases from 1.3s to 8.3s at peak load
   - **Recommendation**: Review authentication caching strategy


### Response Time Scaling

| Service Category | Load Impact | Performance Characteristic |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Authentication | High Impact | 275-280% increase from base load |
| Educational Content | Moderate Impact | 180-200% increase from base load |
| Content Creation | Severe Impact | 188-300% increase from base load |


## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Title Creation Service**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching where applicable
   - Consider async processing for non-critical operations

2. **Authentication Services**
   - Implement token caching
   - Review session management
   - Consider distributed caching solution

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Educational Content**
   - Implement CDN for static content
   - Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries

2. **Stop1 Service**
   - Review database indexing
   - Optimize query patterns
   - Consider request batching

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Title Creation service may become unusable under peak load
- Authentication services may create bottleneck during high traffic

### Moderate Risk
- Educational content access may slow during peak hours

### Low Risk
- Broadcast authentication maintains acceptable performance
- Basic user operations remain stable

## Conclusion

The system demonstrates good baseline performance but shows stress under increased load. While core functionalities remain operational, specific services require optimization to maintain acceptable performance under high load conditions. The authentication and content creation services should be prioritized for immediate optimization.
